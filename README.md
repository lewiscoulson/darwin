Update Policy
========================

When an improvement can be suggested it should be written up in the form of a proposal for submission to the Framework owner. This allows for a quick turnaround of a requirements document.
When a bug is found it should be reported to either the service desk or the Framework owner. This will be evaluated by us and passed on an agency for review if a viable solution is not found.

Depending on the scale of the change or fix it will developed in-house or through an agency.

During and after development UAT and regression testing will be carried out by either FDM or in-house to ensure compatibility with the current implementations of the Framework across the site. Any unavoidable issues should be documented for reference of site owners for consideration when utilising the updated version of the Framework.
 
The update will be reviewed by the Framework owner to make sure it meets the Digital Development Guidelines. If a new feature or change contradicts the current guidelines they will be updated accordingly.

 The updated Framework will be uploaded and distributed via GitHub. The file release version number will be updated accordingly depending on the scale of the update. 
Release notes on the repository will be updated providing details of the changes made. 

All users utilising the framework will receive an email notification that the framework has been updated and will receive a copy of the framework update notes and a link to the GitHub repository.
